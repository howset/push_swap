## General
1. The `main` function in push_swap.c first checks for valid arguments by calling `ft_argcheck` in utils_checks.c. This function is responsible for splitting the input to args if necessary by using `ft_split` (from libft). Then it checks if the args are all valid numbers (`ft_isnbr`), if not, then error are printed by the function `ft_prt_err` in utils_free+print.c. Duplicates are checked with `ft_isdupli`. If `ft_split` is utilized, then due to memory allocation, <kbd>args</kbd> has to be freed.
2. Then the <kbd>stacks a & b</kbd> are allocated by malloc. The stacks' structure are declared in the header file, which is a singly linked list that contains an index (to determine the most efficient sequence of operations to sort the stack -e.g., if an element is far from its correct position in the sorted stack (i.e., its index is far from its value), it might be more efficient to use a series of rotates or reverse rotates to move it to its correct position, rather than using a series of pushes and swaps.). <kbd>stack a</kbd> is initialized by the function `stack_init` in push_swap.c.
3. The declared variable <kbd>args</kbd> contains all the arguments. The loop creates a new node by calling the function `ft_lst_newnode` (in utils_list.c) and adds it to the back of the stack by the using the function `ft_lst_nodeback`.
	- The `ft_lst_newnode` function adds the value to the newly created node, assigns the <kbd>index</kbd> value at -1 (sentinel value, real value will be set by the function `index_stack`) and set the <kbd>next</kbd> pointer of the stack to NULL. The `ft_lst_node2back` checks if the stack is empty or not. If it is empty, it makes the <kbd>new_node</kbd> as the first node. If it is not empty, then it calls the `ft_lst_pointer2last` to get the pointer to the last node in the stack. Then the `ft_lst_node2back` sets the <kbd>next</kbd> field of the last node in the stack to the <kbd>new_node</kbd>, and the <kbd>next</kbd> field of the <kbd>new_node</kbd> to NULL.
4. Then after the stack has been populated by the values, the function `index_stack` (in utils_index.c) assigns the proper indexes.
